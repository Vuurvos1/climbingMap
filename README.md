# Toplogger Map

Playing around with the Toplogger API to create a map of boulders in a gym

## Get started

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

Build an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
